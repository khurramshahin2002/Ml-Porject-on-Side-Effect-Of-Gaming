Introduction based on a Gaming Dataset 
The gaming industry has experienced phenomenal growth in recent years, fueled by 
advancements in technology and the increasing popularity of online platforms. This 
dynamic landscape necessitates a deeper understanding of player behavior and trends.

investigates. This could encompass player demographics, in-game behaviour, game

gameplay logs, purchase history, survey responses, social media interactions, or game 
telemetry data. Research Objectives: Briefly mention the overarching goals of your 
research using the dataset. What do you hope to learn or achieve through the analysis?
